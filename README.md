## Getting Started

Clone this repository, and install its depencies using `yarn install`. On MacOS donÂ´t forget to use sudo because of some dependencies that need to be compiled.

Then run the following:

```bash
npm run build

npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can add an `env.local` file to override the external api to use the internal middleware `mongodb` back-end.

Also you can see this project deployed [https://s-n-v-test.vercel.app/](here).
